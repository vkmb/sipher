       In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar\'s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar\'s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security. The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it with a shift of three to protect messages of military significance. While Caesar\'s was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier.\n

        Create Secret Message:
        \n\t 1)In the message text box  type the message to be encrypted.
        \n\t 2)In the shift text box  type the number of places to be shifted.
        \n\t 3)Click the save icon to encrypt and save the message.
        \n\t 4)Click the send icon to send the encrypted message.
        \n\t Note: Without encrypting you can\'t send the message.
        \n\t       Encrypted Messages that are copied automatically are in the format "xxxxxxxx-shift".\n
        Decrypt Message:
        \n\t 1)In the message text box  type the message to be decrypted.
        \n\t 2)In the shift text box  type the number of places to be shifted.
        \n\t 3)Click the upload icon to decrypt the message.
        \n\t 4)Click the send icon to send the encrypted message.
